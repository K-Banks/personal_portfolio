    <div>
      <p>I built this app to demonstrate all the concepts I learned throughout my short time programming with an emphasis on my fondness for API's and music. This was inspired by the realization that Spotify has so much information about its users' preferences with very little engaging interaction amongst them. After ironing out the source code for the single-player mode, I am tackling multiplayer and allowing a new form of interaction based on mutual tastes in music.</p>

      <p>This project was a challenge, particularly with callbacks, recursive code and handling O-Authentication protocol. Working through these problems helped me develop a deeper understanding of complex functionality while also refactoring my own to be more efficient and flexible.</p>
