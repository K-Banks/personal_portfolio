      <p>Click the button above to retrieve a random spell from my database. During development, I became much more familiar with how to handle API requests from the backend. This project was built using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <ul>
          <li>IntelliJ</li>
          <li>Maven</li>
          <li>Gradle</li>
          <li>JUnit</li>
        </ul>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Heroku for hosting</li>
        <li>Postman</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Finding spells in the middle of a game can be incredibly difficult and break the flow of the game. By building my own database, hosting it, creating various access points for my API, I was able to build rudimentary understanding and skill in backend development.</p>
      <p>The biggest hurdle I came across during development was figuring out how to handle CORS so that requests can be made from outside of the same domain. Prior to implementing CORS, I was unable to make requests from the API outside of Postman. </p>
